Take the well-made light theme from Visual Studio (2017 Edition) and bring it to VS-Code. A well-rounded, well-made light theme that won't burn your eyes off.

## Version 1.0.0
* Initial Release
* Aquired a syntax theme similar to VS's, curtosy of [this repository](https://github.com/mihaifm/Visual-Studio.tmTheme).
* Copied as much as I could straight from Visual Studio 2017.
